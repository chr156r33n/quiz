"To put a Google Search Console bulk export in place, you need to have a billing account linked to the project you want to use.",TRUE,FALSE,,,,a

How does BigQuery round the cost of a query?,"BigQuery rounds the cost of queries to the nearest Byte, with a minimum of 15 MB data processed per table referenced by the query, and a minimum of 10 MB data processed per query","BigQuery rounds the cost of queries to the nearest MB, with a minimum of 10 MB data processed per table referenced by the query, and a minimum of 10 MB data processed per query","BigQuery rounds the cost of queries to the nearest MB, with a minimum of 100 MB data processed per table referenced by the query, and a minimum of 10 MB data processed per query",,,b
Why are samples usefil for limiting costs? There might be multiple correct answers.,They avoid querying a complete set of data.,They give you control over the amount of tows your query uses.,It helps to predict costs.,It uses AI to limit costs.,,"a,b"
Which of the following reasons is true for why you should avoid using SELECT *?,"SELECT * queries automatically trigger a full table scan, even when filters are applied.","Using SELECT * scans all columns in a table, which increases the amount of data processed and thus the query cost, as BigQuery bills are based on the volume of data scanned when using on-demand pricing.","BigQuery charges a fixed fee for each column included in a SELECT statement, regardless of the data volume.",,,a
"What information can you find in the ""Job information"" tab when running a query? Multiple answers might be correct.","The Job information tab provides detailed statistics about the query execution, such as the amount of data processed, execution time, and the number of bytes billed. This helps users understand the resource consumption of their queries.","It includes a breakdown of the query execution plan and timeline, allowing users to analyze how different stages of the query were executed. This is useful for optimizing query performance.",The Job information tab provides real-time updates on data changes in the queried tables. (This is false because the Job information tab does not offer real-time data updates; it only provides details about the specific query execution.),"It shows detailed user authentication logs for each query run, including IP addresses and login times. (This is false because the Job information tab does not display user authentication logs; it focuses on query execution details.)","The Job information tab contains a complete history of all queries run by all users in the project. (This is false because while it provides details for individual queries, it does not maintain a comprehensive history of all queries run by all users.)","a,b"
Which of the following is correct?,The first 100 GB of data processed each month is free for all BigQuery users.,BigQuery automatically applies discounts to queries that process less than 1 GB of data.,"BigQuery charges a fixed fee for each column included in a SELECT statement, regardless of the data volume.","BigQuery offers free usage quotas, including 1 TB of query processing per month and 10 GB of storage, which can help reduce costs for small-scale or experimental projects.",,d
Which tip(s) to limit costs in BigQuery is correct? Multiple answers might be correct.,Optimize queries by selecting only necessary columns and applying filters early to reduce the amount of data processed,Use SELECT * with LIMIT clause to reduce query costs.,Use the Preview tab to access your data instead of querying it whenever it makes sense.,"Running queries on smaller tables does not incur any costs. (This is incorrect because all queries, regardless of the size of the table, will incur costs based on the amount of data processed.)",,"a,c"
